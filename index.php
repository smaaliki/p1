            <h2>My Bio</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a Senior Consultant at the Executive Council of Dubai.  Previously, I dabbled in iOS application development and prior to that I was a Senior Project Manager at Abiomed, a leading developer and manufacturer for cardiovascular devices.  I graduated from Boston University and from University of Miami with a BS and a MS in Biomedical Engineering, respectively.<br/>  
                When asked about my hobbies, I tell people that I love woodworking, playing guitar and sailing but I have no time for any of the above.</p>
